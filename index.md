### 2020: A Time of Generalized Unrest


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Taking a closer look at <b>2020</b> and comparing it to previous years, we observe that it follows a similar <b>seasonal pattern</b>, with a bell curve peaking in the summer months. However, the increase in 2020 was notably <b>abrupt</b>. The unique circumstances of 2020, marked by the COVID-19 <b>pandemic</b> and the <b>Black Lives Matter protests</b> in th US, set it apart as a highly unusual year. Notably, the first significant <b>rise</b> in shootings occurred in <b>March</b>, coinciding with the initial COVID-19 <b>lockdown</b> and the murder of <b>George Floyd</b>. The year 2021 saw a continuation and aftermath of this spike, whereas by 2022, shooting incidents had returned to average levels.

To explore whether the <b>Black Lives Matter</b> protests <b>influenced</b> the levels of gun violence, we examined the <b>racial distribution of shooting victims</b>. Despite the exponential increase in shooting incidents, this distribution remained <b>consistent with previous years</b>, suggesting that while the protests may have contributed to overall unrest, the surge in shootings was <b>not racially motivated</b>.

Turning our attention to the likely predominant factor behind many of 2020's challenges, COVID-19, considering the <b>pandemic's broader impact</b>, which includes a global <b>increase in serious crimes</b><sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. Although definitive conclusions are difficult, the <b>trends in gun violence</b> appear to <b>align</b> with those of another pandemic-related issue: <b>layoffs</b>. Google search trends for 'layoffs' in New York City peaked in May and August of 2020, with the initial surge beginning in March, <b>mirroring</b> the timing of increased shootings and coinciding with the first lockdowns. The decline in searches during June and July aligns with the typical slowdown in business activity during the summer months.
