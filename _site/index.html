<h2 id="overview-of-new-york-shooting-incidents-2006-2024">Overview of New York Shooting Incidents (2006-2024)</h2>

<h3 id="dataset-introduction">Dataset Introduction</h3>
<p>This dataset provides a detailed look at shooting incidents in New York from 2006 to 2024, revealing trends and details about these events. It is an important tool for understanding city crime and safety over almost twenty years.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-attributes">Dataset Attributes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incident Date</strong>: Captures the exact date each shooting occurred, providing a timeline for analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Borough</strong>: Indicates the specific borough within New York where the incident took place, crucial for geographic analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident Time</strong>: The time at which the incident occurred, valuable for identifying patterns related to time of day or night.</li>
  <li><strong>Victim Count</strong>: Records the number of individuals impacted in each incident, which helps in understanding the severity.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident Type</strong>: Describes the nature of the incident, such as robbery or altercation, offering insights into the causes of shootings.</li>
  <li><strong>Perpetrator and Victim Demographics</strong>: Includes age, gender, and race of those involved, allowing for demographic analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Location Coordinates</strong>: Latitude and longitude for mapping and spatial analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analysis-objectives">Analysis Objectives</h3>
<p>Through detailed data exploration, this project aims to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trend Analysis</strong>: Examine how the frequency and nature of shootings have evolved over the years.</li>
  <li><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong>: Identify areas within New York that are more prone to shootings and understand the geographical distribution.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on 2020</strong>: Analyze the sharp increase in shooting incidents during 2020, a year marked by significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest following the death of George Floyd. This analysis will explore how these events and the associated Black Lives Matter movement may have influenced crime rates and police activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="visualization-and-tools">Visualization and Tools</h3>
<p>To effectively communicate our findings, we will utilize:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive Maps</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Charts and Graphs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Animated heatmaps(or graphs)</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-overview-with-graphs">Data Overview with Graphs</h3>
<h4 id="number-of-shooting-incidents-per-year">Number of shooting incidents per year</h4>
<p>This bar plot illustrates the number of shooting incidents reported annually in New York from 2006 through 2022. It provides a visual representation of the trends in gun-related violence over a period of nearly two decades.</p>

<p>Here load the plot(Number of shooting incidents per year)</p>

<p>The plot reveals a relatively stable trend with slight fluctuations in the number of shootings annually until a noticeable dip between 2013 and 2017, where the incidents decreased to their lowest at around 970 per year. Post-2017, there is a sharp increase, peaking in 2020 with around 1,200 incidents. This peak coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest following significant events like the death of George Floyd, which likely contributed to the heightened number of incidents due to increased social and economic stressors. We will delve deeper into these correlations and their implications in a later section of our analysis.</p>

<h4 id="number-of-shooting-incidents-by-borough">Number of shooting incidents by borough</h4>

<p>This bar plot illustrates the distribution of shooting incidents across the five boroughs of New York over the period from 2006 to 2024. It provides a clear comparison of the relative frequency of incidents in each area, highlighting potential hotspots for crime.</p>

<p>Plot here(number of shooting incidents by borough)</p>

<p>From the plot, it is evident that Brooklyn has the highest number of reported shooting incidents, significantly surpassing other boroughs. Following Brooklyn, the Bronx also shows a high number of incidents, while Manhattan, Queens, and particularly Staten Island report fewer shootings.</p>

<h4 id="number-of-shooting-incidents-by-location-description">Number of shooting incidents by location description</h4>
<p>This bar plot categorizes shooting incidents in New York by the type of location where they occurred from 2006 to 2024.
The plot displays a diverse range of locations, with high frequencies noted at bars, gas stations, liquor stores, and nightclubs, indicating these as common venues for shootings. This suggests that areas with higher levels of social interaction, especially where alcohol may be involved, are more prone to such incidents. Conversely, places like banks, schools, and multi-dwelling houses report relatively fewer incidents, which might reflect the effectiveness of security measures or the nature of activities at these sites.</p>

<p>Plot here</p>

<p>The peak at “Street” reflect a significant number of incidents occurring in unspecified locations or directly on the streets, underlining the pervasive nature of gun violence across urban settings beyond controlled environments.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-of-demographic-data-in-shooting-incidents">Analysis of Demographic Data in Shooting Incidents</h4>

<p>This series of bar plots provides a demographic breakdown of shooting incidents in New York from 2006 to 2024, categorizing the data by age, sex, and race of both perpetrators and victims. These visualizations are crucial for understanding who is most affected by gun violence and may help guide targeted interventions.</p>

<p>Plot here</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Age Group</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The data shows a significant concentration of both perpetrators and victims in the 18-44 age range, indicating that young adults are the most affected by shootings. Notably, involvement drops markedly in age groups 45 and above, which suggests that gun violence is predominantly an issue among younger individuals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sex</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A striking disparity is observed in the involvement of males compared to females, with males significantly more likely to be both perpetrators and victims. This highlights the gender-specific nature of gun violence, where males are disproportionately affected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Race</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The racial analysis reveals that Black individuals are the most frequently involved in shooting incidents, both as perpetrators and victims, followed by Hispanic individuals. This disproportionate impact on these communities suggests the presence of deeper socio-economic and systemic factors at play.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
